# dotnet-disk-imager
dotNet equivalent to Win32 Disk Imager, but more lightweight and with more features.

This program is highly inspired by Win32 Disk Imager and sort of copies it's function.

However, I've added some features, like verification of readed/writed image file and the most important is on the fly support for zipped images.

Another features worth mentioning are simultaneous write to multiple devices at one time or wiping of device filesystem and partitions.

I would be happy to hear your feedback and I'm ready to listen to your suggestions. Feel free to request new features, if I found them interesting I will definitely implement them.

Requires .NET Framework 4.6.1
Supports Windows 7 and newer.
If you need older Windows support, use Win32 Disk Imager.
